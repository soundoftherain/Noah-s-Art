        Hello, my name is Noah Moses. Iâ€™m a singer, songwriter, and programmer, and the creator of Noahâ€™s Art â€” a living universe of characters expressed through music, story, and blockchain technology.
        From Feathers, the blues-wailing peacock, to Hoodlum, a rooster with a poetic flow, every character carries a unique sound, message, and energy.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
        The long-term mission is Noahâ€™s Protocol â€” a decentralized ecosystem merging art, story, and technology through Proof of Help and Proof of Behavior.
